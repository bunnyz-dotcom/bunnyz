                    <h4>About AI and Drawing with Computer</h4>
                    <p class="date">Feb 2, 2026</p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, 75% of time when artist draw something they use reference, that doesn't mean they don't draw the thing, they still have to 
                        interpret the thing with the artist eye and draw it stroke by stroke, line by line, they might take something very ordinary and draw it into
                        something very beautiful, or they take a photograph of some beautiful scenery and drew it into a painting, you think that's easy? You try it<br><br>

                        And use AI as reference means instead of search up on Google for a photo, or go out to take a photo, or look at an object, you use an AI created picture 
                        as reference, so it's basically the same as using anything else as reference, just that now you can use a prompt to create something unrealistic
                        and use it, sometimes you reference a few AI pictures instead of just one to create one art, which you still have to draw them stroke by stroke, line by line <br><br>

                        Regarding drawing on computer, back then in early 2000s people use their mouse to draw on computers, they use mouse like a pen, moving the brush
                        across the screen. Which is a very troublesome thing, then, something invented Wacom Tablet, which is a pen shaped mouse, with a rectangle board 
                        represent the screen, and now you can draw on computer like you draw on a piece of paper. <br><br>

                        Now that you knew, using AI as reference is just like using normal reference, and using computer to draw is just like drawing on paper. Of course, with
                        computer there are features like Layers, Layer properties, that a traditional drawing tool don't have. But the pleasure of brush stroke move on paper
                        which can help creating better drawing, computer don't have. So there are pros and cons depending on what you click with. <br><br>

                        So don't like people who don't understand technology of art limit what you can create!

                    <h4>Re-make of my website, health discovery</h4>
                    <p class="date">Jan 22, 2026</p>
                    <p>
                        I finally re-made my website. What do you think?<br><br>

                        Last year I got scammed by Wix and they charged me $500something for the website
                        They probably think I'll always rely on them to make normal websites, So! I learned
                        to make it myself, and made this. Even though some features are missing, like
                        commenting, send me an email and so on. <br><br>

                        And some parts of the website is still not perfect, but over all it is ok to look at.<br><br>

                        If you have any suggestions, leave me a comment on one of my YouTube video, and
                        I'll look into it <br><br>

                        Done with explaining about my new website, lately I discovered another secret to lose weight.
                        Which is solve constipation issue.<br><br>

                        I haven't completely solve this issue yet, but I've been eating much more fruits and vegetables,
                        and drinking soup, and I don't eat vegetables raw. So far it improved my constipation by 65%,
                        which
                        is a lot. And I've lost about 3kg, it's not a crazy amount, but I was able to maintain it.
                        <br><br>

                        The most helpful food for constipation I discovered so far is Korean vegetable pancake
                        (Yachaejeon),
                        it is so so helpful. Another would be Banana. If you are not having easy bowel movements
                        you should try them. It's not for emergency quick fix, but for to nurture regular bowel
                        movement.<br><br>

                        Trust me, if you fix constipation you've fixed 60% of your weight.<br><br>
                        below is a picture of my Korean vegetable pancake

                    <h4>This is my today</h4>
                    <p class="date">Jan 6, 2026</p>
                    <p>I quit my job a month ago, it was an irrational decision, or is it? <br><br>


                        I try to make staying home just as productive as working, so I worked on personal project and
                        job hunt for a total for 4 hours, which now I'm thinking of new strategy to implement more into
                        my day. <br><br>


                        Now on my list, personal projects, job hunt, reading, cooking, and mild exercise. <br><br>


                        Job hunt is the most painful part, because it feels like throwing rocks into the ocean, where
                        soon it's like you did nothing, so I add different projects to ease my pain, and it's working,
                        but it's not enough, when I'm not doing anything (like at this very moment) it just feels like
                        I'm not making any progress. <br><br>


                        I'm not forcing anyone to be my friend, but I really need help to come up with some kind of
                        idea, but when I lean too much on people to come up with ideas for me, it starts to make them
                        seem like they are doing me a big favour, and their time and energy is spent on me, when they
                        could be doing better things.<br><br>


                        I just wish I can come up with some idea of what to do, something that sparks in me and make my
                        days feel fulfilled. Hopefully by the end of day there will be new ideas.

                    <h4>Regarding the election</h4>
                    <p class="date">April 27, 2025</p>
                    <p>The Canadian federal election, everyone says to vote for Carney, while I'm not against him, but I
                        voted for Poilievre, How you vote is that you vote for the conservative party, not him. Because
                        for conservatives maybe government would do less reckless things, and the country can catch up
                        with it's savings, and people can over all pay less tax eventually when we catch up with the
                        savings. <br><br>


                        Currently since we are all Canadians we'll just need to continue to suffer with the government,
                        since the government had kept on spending so much money with out thinking of the
                        consequences.<br><br>


                        Look at Trump, he filed national emergency for other countries to send their criminals over (not
                        sure if it works though, since real criminals knows how to hide, you might end up sending
                        innocent people) but! at least the effort is there, is they kept on adjusting and finding the
                        perfect approach.<br><br>


                        It is nice that countries are compassionate, and have dreams, but some vague dreams are in the
                        cost of people's income and safety (I heard there are so many people's home got broken into! I
                        personally knows some people got broken into, if you've heard of someone you know got broken
                        into that means it's already happening a lot) <br><br>


                        Hopefully everyone can be secure, safe, and start earning again. Hopefully our lives would
                        improve, keep at it, to myself too!

                    <h4>News - Good education to get, good food to eat</h4>
                    <p class="date">Mar 31, 2025</p>
                    <p>So I've been reading news again, and see some good insights, there's one on what you can study
                        that is hot now, meaning, people are looking for these workers, so here let me list a few:
                        project management, financial planner, information security manager, solution architect, cloud
                        architect, nurse <br><br>


                        I personally think nurse is a profession that'll never be replaced by AI, think about it, you
                        need to feel the patient's veins and plug a needle in it and get blood out, I doubt a robot can
                        accurately do it.<br><br>


                        Talk about nurse, I read on a few food that's healthy, I kept of reading these, and there's 4 I
                        think is really yummy and healthy at the same time, which is pepper (eat that spice!!), beans,
                        pasta, salmon.<br><br>


                        And other than these four, you can eat a lot of leafy greens, which I'm trying to eat more of it
                        for my body to recover, as for about a month or two, I nearly only eat meat, and cookies, and
                        drink 3 cups of coffee a day with Cocoa powder added to it, and create huge tragedies in my
                        health.<br><br>


                        So yeah, stay healthy! So that you can stay employed without hurting your self
                    </p>

                <div class="blogPost mt-5">
                    <h4>I'm making change to my Blog, plus news sharing</h4>
                    <p class="date">Mar 15, 2025</p>
                    <p>
                        Since around 2 and half month ago I got interested in reporting news, so I made a secret account
                        to report news, but there's no views after I consistently posted for 2 month, so I decide to
                        write about the news here instead. And because of that I'm changing the format of my blog, so
                        the newest blog will be on top, and because I have to move information over to the new blog,
                        I'll be not moving forward unimportant blogs from the past. <br><br>

                        Anyways on with the news for now. First of all Carney have become the Prime Minister. A few
                        things he's going to do is: He's not going to visit Trump in the next few days. He'll visit
                        Paris and London, and he's going to cut ministerial salaries and staff. He's also going to cut
                        consumer fuel charge to zero, and give incentive to purchase "greener" appliances. <br><br>

                        Second news is, there's a lot of issues with DOGE, which is Elon Musk's team to cut cost for
                        U.S.A. government. First issue is that, because federal law prohibits government employees such
                        as Elon Musk to have financial interest with government program, they are now receiving a
                        complaint from Campaign Legal Center because the FAA(which is Federal Aviation Administration,
                        over sees space transportation) are having a deal with StarLink(which its parent company is
                        SpaceX) <br><br>

                        The second DOGE related news is IRS Chief Counsel William Paul have been removed. What is IRS,
                        it is The Internal Revenue Service, Which Administers U.S. federal tax laws. They work on tax
                        laws enforcement, litigation, collection, bankruptcy and sommons advice. Recently around 3,500
                        IRS employees are expected to be laid off. So Paul says DOGE shouldn't get access to the
                        companies' information. So he will most likely be replaced by Andrew De Mello. <br><br>

                        Is DOGE doing the right thing? I don't know, I'm a Trump supporter, and I know Elon Musk is
                        trying to help. But I personally don't know the effect of the unsubtle way they manage, maybe it
                        works? Or maybe it's too quick too insensitive? I just hope it turns out for the best.

                    <h4>Book Review - Food Shed</h4>
                    <p class="date">Jul 22, 2024</p>
                    <p>
                        Recently I read a book called FoodShed by Dee HobsBawn-Smith, it says how we eat is in a way how
                        we use the world. Which I totally agree, it wrote about around 60 farms the author had visited.
                        If we choose to eat organic food, people will use the time to grow more grass to feed the
                        animals we eat, eat wild, protect wild animal's living environment. Might possibly start making
                        small changes to the world. <br><br>

                        I once heard from a model, we are what we eat, because what we eat made the cells in our body.
                        So eat more organic, eat more whole food. Even when we eat junk food, use recyclable containers!
                        Who knows, maybe when we do that not only we become more beautiful, the world also become a more
                        sustainable place
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today we'll talk about a few things, let's start with what food we should eat more what we
                        should avoid eating. <br><br>



                        First of all, we should eat more fruit and vegetables, it's got antioxidants, vitamins, mineral
                        and fiber. After we get the most important food out of the way, we should also eat these food
                        more: fish, broccoli, spinach or leafy greens, kale, nut butter, mangos, <br><br>

                        See? These are all pretty yummy, Also eat whole grain instead of refined grains. <br><br>



                        And avoid eating these: food with added sugar, low calory sweeteners, no calory sweeteners,
                        foods high in salt (like canned food, hot dogs, frozen dinner), foods high in mercury (like
                        shark, I mean who would eat shark, please eat normal fish, bigeye tuna, not sure what that is,
                        must be a weird fish), unpasteurized food or drink (I think this one everyone agree on) <br><br>

                        If you want to know what fish to eat here's a chart, most fish are good to eat, but there are
                        weird ones:<br><br>

                        <br><br>



                        Now let's talk about how we can eat, <br><br>

                        First, we can meal prep, there's a lot of benefit, for me, if I meal prep when I want to eat the
                        food is there, especially if you make it yummy, when you want to buy outside, you just think of
                        the yummy food you can just heat up and eat, then you won't buy restaurants that meal. It is
                        healthier because you can follow nutritional guild line when meal prepping, it saves money, and
                        you'll stress less on weekdays. Secondly, you'll plan it out and use the exactly amount of
                        grocery you bought; it reduces food waste. <br><br>



                        Here are some tips on how to meal prep! 1.You can start small by making a few meals and snack
                        first if your cook skill and kitchenware is limited, this is my case, I would cook 10 tea egg
                        and once, and eat 1 or two a day, when I feel tired of making omelet everyday, or if I have to
                        work, I'll cook one big pod of meal, and divide them into around 4 to 5 containers, then I don't
                        have to remember to bring lunch everyday, and when I have yummy meal waiting for me, I won't buy
                        lunch. <br>

                        2.Get organized, organize your fridge and cabinet, knowing what ingredients you have, write down
                        the ingredients you need to cook what you want to cook, and mark out the ingredients you need to
                        buy, so there's won't be duplicate. <br>

                        3.Prepare the containers for meal prep, once you are done you can divide some necessary ones you
                        need to put in containers in containers. <br>

                        4.have in the pantry what you need, like whole grains, oil, baking essentials<br>

                        5.meal prep is a lifestyle, block out a time a week to do it<br>

                        6.Vary your menu, this way it's yummy enough that you don't want to buy outside when you think
                        of your meal <br>

                        7.have a place for your recipes, this way you can accumulate recipes you cook and feel really
                        good about your progress, if some recipe you like very much you can also cook it again <br><br>



                        Ok, here's meal prep, next is mindful eating, being mindful when you eat can help you eat less,
                        better your digestion, and you'll be aware of what you are eating so you make better food
                        choices next time.<br><br>

                        You can mindful eating by making eating a ritual, sit and eat, eat slowly, savor the food, and
                        chew thoroughly. Basically if you can gather your family members, sit together at a round table
                        and just eat and do nothing else, and enjoy the food, it'll be really helpful. <br><br>



                        Next one is hydrate, can't emphasize enough on how important it is to have enough water in your
                        body. Drinking water can help bring nutrient to cells, get rid of waste, protects joints and
                        organs and maintain body temperature. See how important that is.<br><br>

                        How you can drink more water is to have a big bottle that you like, fill it with water, when you
                        are thirsty you can sip some, and you have a few sip every half hour, but if you enjoy drinking
                        water you don't need to do that, you can also make some tea without sugar or cream, like Chinese
                        green tea, or Indian Chai, their flavors are light, and just add a bit of twist in water to make
                        it taste better, don't have it so dense, just a few tea leaves would do. <br><br>



                        Ok, I know it's a lot of tip in the trilogy I wrote, you can pick a few easier to do to start
                        first, or if you want to make a big change in your diet now then go for it! Make it fun, buy the
                        new pot, make that nut snack, make that tea! Make that chart for your calory counting, buy and
                        cut that cucumber!<br><br>



                        If you have something to share you can leave me a message in Contact Me session, I'll share it
                        with everyone if it is helpful, now go and eat something healthy.<br><br><br>

                    <h4>Healthy Eating Trilogy Part 2</h4>
                    <p class="date">June 28, 2024</p>
                    <p>
                        Let start with calories today, what is calories:<br><br>

                        Calories are unit of energy from caloric theory of heat, it's the amount of heat needed to raise
                        the temperature of 1 Liter of water by 1-degree Celsius. <br><br>

                        And we need energy from calories for body to work properly, but if you eat and drink the same
                        amount of calories, with the same type of food and burn the same amount of calories (burn
                        calories is exercising), then your body is going to stay the same. So in order to lose weight
                        you will need calories deficit, even though what kind of calories are you eating is also
                        important, like are you eating healthy calories or unhealthy ones? But if you are eating healthy
                        calories but ate tons and move the same amount, you'll still gain weight, in average a woman
                        need to eat 2000 calories a day and a man 2500, of course it differs depend on your age, height,
                        and how active you are, here is a calculator in this article: <br><br>

                        <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day#calculator">Calories
                            calculator link</a><br><br>


                        You can calculate how many calories you need to eat to lose weight with above link, also, if you
                        eat below the amount you'll become unhealthy, and you won't get good body shape, I accidentally
                        did it once, that I didn't eat much because I was unhappy and don't have appetite, and I ate
                        extremely less for 4 to 5 month, and my belly did not reduce, but my chest reduced, and I look
                        so bad. So do use the calculator! <br><br>

                        You can also do more exercise than usual, but eat right and you already won 70% of the
                        battle.<br><br>


                        Now we'll talk about what calories we should intake, in general, a balanced diet,<br><br>

                        a person name Eric from Mind Valley said instead of thinking what to take from your diet, think
                        of what to add in your diet. (This does not include junk food, although if you really crave, a
                        tiny bit of junk food is fine I guess, but not too much) anyways, back to topic, so you gotta
                        eat a variety of food, don't go to an extreme diet like not eating any animal products at all,
                        or not eat any carbs at all, instead, think, I ate so much meat and so less veggies, now I'm
                        going to eat less meat, the meat is going to be healthy lean meat, and some fish, and I'll add
                        more variety vegetables into my diet, or I love carbs and I don't eat proteins, now I'm going to
                        add some tofu into my diet, or some chickpeas, or I always eat my vitamin pills to eat less, now
                        you are going to make room for some fruits to add some micronutrients into your body.<br><br>


                        Let me paste some examples of a balanced meals:<br><br>

                        Breakfast: - Greek yogurt + berries + peanut butter - tortilla + egg and cheese + salsa - congee
                        with chia seeds + tofu and miso soup + side vegetables like pickled cucumber <br>
                        Lunch or dinner:
                        -Salmon and avocado salad -pan fried porkchop with mash potatoes and spinach salad -beef stir
                        fry with vegetable<br><br>


                        Now that we know the importance of a balanced diet, we can look at portion control, as we talked
                        about it in calories deficit, I'll have to say, if you are 155cm, and you are not pregnant or
                        doing intense exercise, and you are eating 5 cheese burgers for a meal, that is definitely going
                        to let you gain or stay at a heavier side weight.<br><br>

                        Here are some tips to portion control, you can: - use smaller plate - keep a food diary to track
                        how much you are eating - drink more water regularly so you are always full with water - eat
                        slowly and savor the food so you are full before you eat more - don't eat from the container,
                        scoop it out and eat the scooped-out portion - read food labels understand how much calories and
                        control your portion <br><br>


                        Ok, this is what I gotta say today, wait for part 3 of my trilogy! <br><br>

                    <h4>Healthy Eating Trilogy Part 1</h4>
                    <p class="date">June 27, 2024</p>
                    <p>
                        Lately I feel healthy eating really helped me reduce a bit of weight. People might feel like
                        they want to lose weight in a night, but it's actually better if you lose one pound or two
                        pounds a week. And healthy eating can play a part in it. <br><br>

                        I just did some research, healthy eating not only help you think for clearly, it also helps with
                        gut health, mood.<br><br>

                        Different height and age, healthy weight varies, you need to find a chart and see where you are
                        at, just type in Google “Healthy weight chart”, here I have one, check if your weight is
                        healthy:<br><br>

                        <a href="https://www.healthifyme.com/blog/height-weight-chart-ideal-weight-for-men-and-women/">Height
                            weight chart link</a><br><br>

                        Being overweight can cause heart disease, type 2 diabetes, liver disease, even cancer. Even if
                        you don't get these, you might still easily feel breathlessness.<br><br>

                        The good news is with healthy eating you already won half of the battle. <br><br>

                        Here is what the food does for you, <br><br>

                        Macronutrient: Protein, fat, carbohydrate gives you energy, and helps you to keep on living,
                        maintain body structure and systems<br><br>

                        In details: Carbs: body's primary fuel, provide energy to muscles and nervous system, some
                        healthy source for it - Whole grain, vegetable, fruits, beans. Unhealthy source are sugary
                        snacks, cereal, donut, soda Protein: provide structure to tissue, include organ, muscle, skin,
                        hair, nails, bones, blood plasma, etc. Some healthy sources of protein are beans, soy product,
                        lean meat, fish, seafood, whole grains. Unhealthy sources are processed meat Fats: Energy
                        reserve, protection of organs. Some healthy sources are avocado, fatty fish. Unhealthy sources
                        are packaged baked goods, fried foods <br><br>

                        These are some of the research examples aligns with my experiences, I still eat fried chicken
                        sometimes, just reduce the unhealthy ones, you don't have to completely don't eat them. And
                        increase healthy food.<br><br>

                        Micronutrients: people need them as much as they need Macronutrients, with Macronutrients you
                        can live, but if you want to be a healthy baby, you need micronutrients too. Scientifically from
                        research, here's what it says “produce enzymes, hormones and other substance needed for normal
                        growth and development”, it also said lack of Micronutrient can cause “visible and dangerous
                        health conditions”, so do eat Micronutrients! Sources of them are by just eating whole food,
                        like instead of eating vitamin C pills, eat an orange, you can eat a pill, but don't forget to
                        eat the orange too, as it has all the Micronutrients. Instead of eating an Omega-3 pill, eat a
                        fish. Whole foods can have much more elements in there, that artificial foods can never have
                        enough <br><br>

                        Ok, here's what I got to say today, I plan to write a trilogy on it, because I'm constantly
                        trying to lose weight, and I found out some information. <br><br><br>
